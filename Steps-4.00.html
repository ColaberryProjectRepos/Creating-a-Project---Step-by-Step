font-size: 18.6667px;">Every project will be documented.&nbsp; Not only will the document the project at completion, but you will also document the things you worked on everyday you work on it.&nbsp; </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(118, 118, 118); font-size: 18.6667px;"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(118, 118, 118); font-size: 18.6667px;">When you finish working on a project and a couple of weeks go by, you will forget all the details of everything you worked on.&nbsp; That's why it is extremely important to use this process while working throughout your project.&nbsp; </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(118, 118, 118); font-size: 18.6667px;"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(118, 118, 118); font-size: 18.6667px;">Navigate to your Center of Excellence program based on your Tier II Tool.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(118, 118, 118); font-size: 18.6667px;"><br></span></p><p><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/206/4/1.jpg"><span style="color: rgb(118, 118, 118); font-size: 18.6667px;"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(118, 118, 118); font-size: 18.6667px;"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(118, 118, 118); font-size: 20px;">By now you should have already created a Project through our automated process.&nbsp; If you have not, navigate <a href="https://app.colaberry.com/app/student/ProjMgmt" target="_blank">here </a>and click on "Add Project" to get started.&nbsp; That link also takes you to Project Dashboard which will give you insight on how well you are doing on your project.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(118, 118, 118); font-size: 20px;"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(118, 118, 118); font-size: 20px;">Our automated process allows you to answer a few questions like the name of the project and how soon do you want to finish it.&nbsp; It then goes out to Basecamp (ProjectMgmt) and builds all the tasks and stress test for you.&nbsp; Then all you have to do is manage your task just as you would in the real world.&nbsp; This is not close to the real thing, this IS the real thing.&nbsp; Enjoy the experience.</span></p><p><br></p><p style="color: rgb(118, 118, 118); font-size: 20px;"><b>Instructions</b>:</p><ol><li style="color: rgb(118, 118, 118); font-size: 20px;">Assign this task to yourself.</li><li style="color: rgb(118, 118, 118); font-size: 20px;">Once you have read through this task and you fully understand it, write a small paragraph with screenshots and notes of what you learned.&nbsp; Then add it as a comment on this task.</li><li style="color: rgb(118, 118, 118); font-size: 20px;">Everyday you work on this task, you will add a minimal of a comment and a screenshot.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://app.colaberry.com/app/network/network/207/projectinstructions" target="_blank">Gifs&nbsp;</a>are good as well.</li><li style="color: rgb(118, 118, 118); font-size: 20px;">Note: You as well as other people will be reading through your project notes.&nbsp; Make sure you talk about your thoughts at the moment so you and others can relive the experience.</li><li style="color: rgb(118, 118, 118); font-size: 20px;">Upon completion, close out the task by marking it complete and navigate back to your Colaberry Project Dashboard.&nbsp; The Dashboard will be updated hourly.</li><p style="color: rgb(118, 118, 118); font-size: 20px;"><br></p></ol><ol><p style="font-size: 20px;"><font color="#085294">Message from the General:</font></p><ul><li style="font-size: 20px;"><font color="#085294">Rushing through this project will not equate to a faster completion time.</font></li><li style="font-size: 20px;"><font color="#085294">This process accelerates your learning, it does not skip over your learning.</font></li><li style="font-size: 20px;"><font color="#085294">Which means you still have to learn all of the lessons, but you don't have to make all of the mistakes.</font></li><li style="font-size: 20px;"><font color="#085294">What the heck does that mean Ali???</font></li><li style="font-size: 20px;"><font color="#085294">I'll tell you -&nbsp; be patient - see you are already rushing. :-)</font></li><li style="font-size: 20px;"><font color="#085294">90% of the mistakes and lessons you need to learn have already been made.&nbsp; We have trapped them in the data.</font></li><li style="font-size: 20px;"><font color="#085294">Click on <a href="https://app.colaberry.com/app/student/stresstestcomp" target="_blank">this </a>link.&nbsp; Remember that Walmart project I showed you a couple of tasks ago, well Type Walmart in the search below the KPI's and watch the dashboard filter by all 5 Stress Test.&nbsp; If you read through it, you will basically relive the project as they were going through it.</font></li><li style="font-size: 20px;"><font color="#085294">Adding up the "Approved Days" column in all 5 Stress test will tell you how long it took to complete the project.&nbsp; It took 73 days to complete that project.&nbsp; It will take you maybe 2-3 hours to read through all of the Stress Test.&nbsp; That means you have saved 73 days of experience.&nbsp; The more projects you go through, the more experienced you get.&nbsp;</font></li><li style="font-size: 20px;"><font color="#085294">Upon completion of this project and adding what you've learned so far, you will be equivalent to someone with 3-5 years of experience.&nbsp; This project is a huge chunk of it.&nbsp; Find 5 projects in Colaberry Network and then find their Stress Test in the Accelerator.&nbsp; Then learn from that project while adding months of experience for each project.</font></li><li style="font-size: 20px;"><font color="#085294">After completing 5 projects, you will have a much smoother time getting started with your project.&nbsp; Lot's of the pressure will be alleviated by becoming more informed.</font></li><li style="font-size: 20px;"><font color="#085294">When you make it to Stress Test 2, your project will be critiqued once every 1-2 days.&nbsp; The goal here is not to get approval as fast as you can, but rather to learn what it takes to have an approved project as fast as you can.&nbsp; Remember we aren't skipping the lessons.&nbsp; We are just speeding up the time it takes you to get them.&nbsp; So when you submit for a Stress Test, while you wait, go spend a few hours going through other projects so you can gain experience between each Stress Test.</font></li><li style="font-size: 20px;"><font color="#085294">This goes against traditional thinking I know, but you and I both want you to get through with this project as soon as possible so just trust me and follow my process to accelerate your experience level.&nbsp; You can only gain experience 2 ways.&nbsp; Your time and another person's time.&nbsp; You only have so much of your time, but you have years worth of other people's time.&nbsp; Use it.&nbsp; Use the data to automate and accelerate your learning.</font></li></ul></ol>
